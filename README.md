# weather-app

I have used Material UI for the UI to make it look better and  have used the regular Fetch API to perform the API calls to the openweathermap. 

I also did create a new account myself to access the Open weather API and then checked the document to find that you have shared the ID. I have used your id to perform the API calls.

I went through the API documentation to find few more cities and their ID â€™s to provide more options in the City Selection.
